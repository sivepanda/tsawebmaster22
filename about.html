        <h1>WHO ARE WE?</h1>
        <p>In 2020 the number of fans in attendance in concerts, sports games, and other venues dropped dramatically due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our mission at (insert website name here) is to fire up the thrill of going to such places, specifically concerts
            or music related events. The truth is that the love for music never died, in fact, it increased over the past year and now as we move back into being a normal functioning society again, people need to feel the excitement of making memories
            with loved ones at a music event once again. As times change the need for adaptation also changes so we present to you our fully digital music festival. Not only will the prices be cheaper, but the artist can also undergo a more creative process
            in their concert giving a truly unique experience to the viewer. Welcome to the event of the future.
            <p>
