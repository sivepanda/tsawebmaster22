                    he discovered the art of rapping. He fell in love with it and got himself a few gigs. At this time he was nearly 60 years old. Many may think he doesn’t have anything special to rap about, but he used his age to answer. Nonetheless,
                    he became even more popular across the country in various age groups.</p>

                    modern wave genre) sound with little to no lyrics as he deems them “unnecessary” to making a good song. Debuting in 2014, he has featured in several video games and sci-fi films. Rarely releasing music, this will be a performance of
                    their third, and most recent, album, Only Through My Eyes - released just last year.</p>
