                <p class="card-body">A 54-year-old Korean artist who goes by the name of Bassthoven. His music is quite distinct from other electronica artists as it connects the old classical theme with the more recent ambient electronic music of today. Although an avid
                    supporter of the revival of classical music, he was introduced to electronica through his son the summer he lost his woodworking job due to the pandemic. His first album was released 2 weeks ago and his first major concert will be

                <p class="card-body">A very private individual, DROOLE’s name, age and other info has been kept secret to the public. It is, however, speculated that they hail from the Netherlands. Their style focuses more on a strict 2013 dubstep (with elements of the more
                    modern wave genre) sound with little to no lyrics as he deems them “unnecessary” to making a good song. Debuting in 2014, he has featured in several video games and sci-fi films. Rarely releasing music, this will be a performance of
                    their third, and most recent, album, Only Through My Eyes - released just last year.</p>

                    experiences quite frequently such as those that made her pursue this genre. She has charted #1 on charts several times as well as earning a Grammy, the very first Vietnamese artist to do so for the Electronic genre.</p>

                    Indonesia, and Germany that met over a virtual group therapy session while suffering from a drinking problem. Since then, they have charted numerous times and, like DROOLE, will be performing their 3rd album, <i>Dwanye</i>.</p>

                <p class="card-body">A 17-year-old electric bass and double bass player, Dfrog creates electronic based tracks. His music is heavily influenced by progressive rock and metal - especially from bands like Haken, Creo, and Dream Theater, with some classical influence
                    as well. He aims to infuse progressive ideas into his electronic music.</p>

                    hype and relatable - not only to his home Pakistani culture, but also his secondary American culture.</p>
