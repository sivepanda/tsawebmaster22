            We've revolutionized what it means to stream events. Our new VR stage allows artists to take a creative path with their music like never before. Not only is it using the most modern VR and AR systems, but, along with the Intillis Novis sound systems,
            allows you to be able to <i>feel</i> like you are at the festival, with the artist. Not only that, but the artist will be able to fully manipulate the 3D space, allowing for never-before seen visual effects to make sure that all
            of your senses are indulged by their music.

            <h1>THE EVENTS</h1>
            <p>NU_WRLD has a wide selection of ways you can attend events. You can opt for a more traditional 2D streaming affair while still being able to take advantage of our room-filling and revolutionary Intillis Novis video and audio codecs, or you
                can opt for a more immersive 3D experience, allowing you to fully indulge yourself in the creative mindsets of your favorite artists. We do this at no overly inflated cost. We make sure our event prices are always accessible for every
                price point, and that every event tier is fairly and competitively priced. We enable you to attend events for a price far more affordable than a physical festival, while still delivering a similar experience.
