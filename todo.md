- need to make a loader to make loading pages less jarring - completed, in review
- need to add more content
    > backstories
    > newsroom
    > events (soundstage and visuals info should prob be in the home screen and events screen should be strictly for events/artists/backstories)
    > main page content - fun festival type things
    > Group picture for about page
    > image carousels?
- add an interactive event calendar -> Combine with location and booking?
- add location index (find closest location and date & return) -> Mapbox Matrix API
    > booking mechanism would be awesome
- FAQ Questions
    > Make a jotform for this
